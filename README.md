# VowelCounterProgram
This program counts the number of vowels in a file:
    1) The user must specify the name of the file (from the command line) to analyze when the program is run. If not, an error should be generated.
    2) Use constants where appropriate.
    3) Use I/O (stream) manipulators to format the output so that it is identical to the example below
    4) Pass the name of the file to read in from the command line.
