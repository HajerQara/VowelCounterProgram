# VowelCounterProgram
This program counts the number of vowels in a file:
   <br> 1) The user must specify the name of the file (from the command line) to analyze when the program is run. If not, an error should be generated.
    <br>2) Use constants where appropriate.
    <br>3) Use I/O (stream) manipulators to format the output so that it is identical to the example below
    <br>4) Pass the name of the file to read in from the command line.
    
Assignment: Modified the program to count three addition letters. I have added the letters 'C', 'B', and 'D'.
